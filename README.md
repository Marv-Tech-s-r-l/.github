## About Us
At **Marv**, we believe travel should be more than ticking boxes on a map — it should be about **real connections** and **authentic experiences**.  
Our AI-powered platform connects **travelers** with **local guides**, helping people discover the hidden stories, culture, and magic of every destination.  

Founded in **2024** in Bucharest, Romania, our mission is to transform travel from pre-made itineraries into **emotionally resonant journeys** tailored to each traveler.

## ✨ What We’re Building
- **AI Assistant (MARVIN):** An intelligent companion that matches travelers with the right local guides.  
- **For Travelers:** Personalized itineraries, authentic local experiences, and stress-free planning.  
- **For Guides:** Tools to connect with travelers, earn extra income, and share their passion for their home.  

## 🚀 Our Vision
We want to reshape the way people experience the world:
- From **checklists → meaningful connections**  
- From **rigid tours → adaptive adventures**  
- From **mass-market → personalized journeys**  

## 🛠️ Open Source & Contributions
As we grow, we’ll be opening parts of our ecosystem to the community:
- Developer tools & APIs  
- SDKs for integrating travel services  
- Open discussions around **AI + Travel** innovation  

Stay tuned for upcoming open-source releases. We’d love to build this journey together. 💡
